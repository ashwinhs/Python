**1. Convert Decimals to Roman**

***Solution 1:*** This is the round about solution which uses the position of the digit in the number and uses some crazy logic to convert from Integer to Roman!

***Solution 2:*** This is a super condensed method to get the same result. Essentially, the logic is to do loop over the tupules/list, divide the number by each of the integers. If the quotient is > 1, then we have match. Multiply that with the roman number to get the actual value.

***Solution 3:*** Same as 2. But uses Enums, Class methods and "yield". Good to understand Python!

**2. Logic Gates** 
This is an exmaple from Interactive python which is particularly interesting since it helps us comprehend "OOP" Object oriented Python.
