# Python
##Python Learning - Udactiy

I recently enrolled to the "Programming Fundamentals with Python" course on Udacity. This folder contains the source code for all the projects that the course asked us to.

###Project 1:
The very forst project was to draw shapes using the "Turtle" module available in Python. Source Code for that will be 
- turtleShapes.py

###Project 2:
The second project was to Send Text Messages from Python script to your Mobile. This uses "Twilio", head over to http://twilio.com/ for details on the API.

###Project 3:
The Third project was to create a script which checks if a file has "curse" words and then alert the user. This script also extended to convert normal test to "Pirate" text. You know, the "arrr" stuff!
This uses request/response from the following sites:
- Profanity: http://www.wdyl.com/profanity?q=<Your Text>
- Pirate: http://isithackday.com/arrpi.php?text=<Your Text>

###Project 4:
The final project is to create a Movie Website, which shows thumbs/posters of movies. When you click on the movie poster, youtube trailer window opens andplays it for you. I have enhanced it to use the following APIs - 
- OMDB API - http://www.omdbapi.com (For Movie Details)
- Google Youtube API (For Youtube trailer Links)
